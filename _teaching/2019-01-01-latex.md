title: Preparing a thesis with LaTeX
slides: /assets/teaching/latex/slides.pdf

I wrote and taught this workshop for Newcastle University's postgraduate
 researcher development programme. The workshop was aimed at students who were
 already familiar with the LaTeX typesetting system, ideally having already
 used LaTeX to produce a publication or Master's thesis. The intention of this
 workshop was to give students a deeper understanding of LaTeX and to prepare
 them for using LaTeX to produce their PhD thesis.
