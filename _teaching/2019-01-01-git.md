This workshop was taught by myself and my friend and colleague
 [Sophie Harbisher](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/postgraduate/current/pgrprofiles/harbishersophie.html).
 This workshop was taught for Newcastle University's postgraduate researcher
 development programme. In this workshop we taught the basics of using Git and
 GitHub. Amongst other things, students were taught how to initialise a
 repository, commit changes, and push and pull from a remote repository.
