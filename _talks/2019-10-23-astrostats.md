title: Bayesian statistics in Astrophysics
slides: /assets/talks/astrostats.pdf
---

I delivered this talk to Newcastle University's applied mathematics department
in October 2019. The intention of this talk was to introduce attendees
 to Bayesian statistics, highlight how it differs from frequentist statistics
and provide an astronomically motivated case study. All the code associated with
these slides can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/jwalton3141/talks/tree/master/astrostats)
