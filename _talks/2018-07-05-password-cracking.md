title: Parameter inference for collective behaviour
slides: /assets/talks/collective-behaviour.pdf
---

In this talk, given in 2018 at Newcastle University, I discussed work I was 
completing as part of my PhD. In particular, I gave a brief introduction to 
the phenomenon of collective behaviour and the related mathematical models used
to simulate these behaviours. I then showed how we can use the [Stan programming
language](https://mc-stan.org/) to learn about individual behaviours from
 field data.
