I gave this talk at Newcastle University's postgraduate forum seminar series. 
This seminar series is intended to be more relaxed than a more traditional academic
seminar environment. Speakers are encouraged to lighten the mathematical load, and
deliver a talk that is accessible to mathematicians from all disciplines.

NB. The original slides were presented in [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/)
format. However, [GitHub's dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) was
_continually_ unhappy with the accompanying package-lock.json file. In an
attempt to permanently silence dependabot, I have converted these reveal.js
slides into PDF format.
