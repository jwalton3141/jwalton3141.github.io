I gave this talk at Newcastle University's postgraduate forum seminar series. 
This seminar series is intended to be more relaxed than a more traditional academic
seminar environment. Speakers are encouraged to lighten the mathematical load, and
deliver a talk that is accessible to mathematicians from all disciplines.
