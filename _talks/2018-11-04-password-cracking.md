title: Hash functions and password cracking
slides: /assets/talks/password-cracking.pdf
---

Cryptographic hash functions have been described as the workhorses of modern 
cryptography, having uses in message authentication, digital signatures and 
password verification. But how do they work and how safe really are they?

In this talk I gave a live
demonstration of password cracking using the software 
[hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) and one of
the university's GPU equipped machines. This machine allowed us to make *over 
4 billion* password attacks per second.

I concluded the talk by discussing how to set and manage passwords in a secure
and safe manner.
