## About Me

I'm a PhD Researcher at Newcastle University, based in the School of Maths, Stats and Physics. My research focuses on collective behaviour, a subject which seeks to understand how individuals such as birds, fish or humans interact in groups to produce macro-level structures such as flocks, schools and crowds.
