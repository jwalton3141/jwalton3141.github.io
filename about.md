# About Me

Greetings! I'm Jack, and this is my website! Here I write about things related
to data science, data engineering and computing. Please take a look around and
feel free to leave a comment on one of my blogs, or get [in touch with me](mailto:jwalton3141@gmail.com),
if you have a question.

For work, I'm currently employed as a data engineer in the insurance industry,
having previously worked as a data scientist at a small start-up. You can see
more details about my employment history by taking a look at [my CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

Once upon a time, I completed a PhD in applied mathematics (you can find a copy
of my thesis [here](/assets/thesis.pdf)).

I try answer questions on StackOverflow whenever I get the time, where I'm
[user jwalton](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021886/jwalton?tab=profile).
I also maintain a [professional profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwalton93/) over on LinkedIn.

Out of work (and off the computer), I enjoy cooking, hiking, climbing and just
generally being outdoors.
