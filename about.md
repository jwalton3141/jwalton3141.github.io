# About Me

<img style="float: left; padding-right:20px" width="112" height="123" src="/assets/portrait.jpg">

My name is Jack Walton. I'm a PhD student at Newcastle University, based in the [School of Maths, Stats and Physics](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/research/). My research focuses on collective behaviour, a subject which seeks to understand how individuals such as birds, fish or humans interact in groups to produce macro-level structures such as flocks, schools and crowds.
