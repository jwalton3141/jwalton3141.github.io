## About Me

<img style="float: left;width: 12%; height: 12%; padding-right:20px" src="/assets/portrait.jpg">

My name is Jack Walton. I'm a PhD student at Newcastle University, based in the School of Maths, Stats and Pyshics. My research focuses on collective behaviour, a subject which seeks to understand how individuals such as birds, fish or humans interact in groups to produce macro-level structures such as flocks, schools and crowds.
