Hi, my name is Jack. I'm a PhD student at Newcastle University, UK, where I'm
based in the [School of Maths, Stats and
Physics](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/research/). My research focuses on
[collective
behaviour](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/284/5411/99.full), a subject
which seeks to understand how macro-level structures, such as flocks, schools
and crowds, can arise from simple interactions between individuals.

On StackOverflow I'm [user
jwalton](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021886/jwalton). I try contribute to
SO whenever I get the time (which seems to be less and less often these days!).
I maintain a [professional profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwalton93/)
over on LinkedIn.

I'm also regularly employed as a subcontractor for [Jumping Rivers
Ltd.](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/)
