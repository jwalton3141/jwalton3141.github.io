# About Me

<img style="float: left; padding-right:20px" width="112" height="123" src="/assets/portrait.jpg">

My name is Jack Walton. I'm a PhD student at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, where I'm based in the [School of Maths, Stats and Physics](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/research/). My research focuses on collective behaviour, a subject which seeks to understand how individuals such as birds, fish or humans interact in groups to produce macro-level structures such as flocks, schools and crowds.

You may also find me over at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021886/ralph), where I contribute whenever I get the time. I list some of my other projects on my CV which can be [found on my github page](https://github.com/jwalton3141/CV/blob/master/cv.pdf). Finally, when I'm not too busy being a full-time student, I lead the occasional programming workshop for [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/), a local data science company.
