# About Me

Hi, my name is Jack. I hold a PhD in applied mathematics (you can find a copy
of my thesis [here](/assets/thesis.pdf)) and love all things computer-related
(except for printers: though I think we can all agree that printers are the
devil).

I work for [Jumping Rivers Ltd.](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/), where I split
my time between performing the role of a data scientist, trainer, and data
engineer.

On StackOverflow I'm [user
jwalton](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11021886/jwalton?tab=profile). With
considerably less flair, I maintain a [professional
profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwalton93/) over on LinkedIn.

Out of work I'm a keen cook, bird-watcher, and general outdoorsman (but indoors
is also good).
