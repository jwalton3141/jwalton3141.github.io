    <a href="/teaching/better_latex.pdf">Better typesetting with LaTeX </a><br/>
	I wrote and taught this workshop for Newcastle University's postgraduate researcher development programme. The workshop was aimed at students who were already familiar with the LaTeX typesetting system, ideally having already used LaTeX to produce a publication or Master's thesis. The intention of this workshop was to give students a deeper understanding of LaTeX and to prepare them for using LaTeX to produce their PhD thesis.
