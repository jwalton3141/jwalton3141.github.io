    <a href="/teaching/better_latex.pdf">Better typesetting with LaTeX </a><br/>
	I wrote and taught this workshop for Newcastle University's postgraduate researcher development programme. The workshop was aimed at students who were already familiar with the LaTeX typesetting system, ideally having already used LaTeX to produce a publication or Master's thesis. The intention of this workshop was to give students a deeper understanding of LaTeX and to prepare them for using LaTeX to produce their PhD thesis.

	This workshop was taught by myself and my friend and colleague <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/postgraduate/current/pgrprofiles/harbishersophie.html">Sophie Harbisher</a>. This workshop was taught for Newcastle University's postgraduate researcher development programme. In this workshop we taught the basics of using Git and GitHub. Amongst other things, students were taught how to initialise a repository, commit changes, and push and pull from a remote repository.
